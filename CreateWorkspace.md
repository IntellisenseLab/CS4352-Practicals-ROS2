On Ubuntu 22.04 terminal, run the following command to source the ROS 2 environment.

``` Linux
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

Once the environment is sourced, let's make a new directory for our workspace. This is where we will do all our upcoming labs. Let's choose the directory name as "robotics". On the same Ubuntu 22.04 terminal, run the following command which will create the new workspace. Then Navigate to the workspace.

``` Linux
mkdir -p ~/robotics/src
cd ~/robotics/src
```
The above code creates a src directory inside ros2_ws and then navigates into it.

Now, we have created the workspace for our course module. Let's get started !
