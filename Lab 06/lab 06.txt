ROS Bag

ROS Bag function is used for recording and playing back data published on a certain topic.
Creating a turtle bot and recording its movements.


ROS 2 Bag package has been installed during the ROS Installation, since you can play with it directly. Hence not,

sudo apt-get install ros-foxy-ros2bag \
                     ros-foxy-rosbag2-converter-default-plugins \
                     Ros-foxy-rosbag2-storage-default-plugins

For the demonstration we’ll be using the turtle bot simulation,
Open up a new terminal and run turtlebot simulation using,

ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node

The turtle bot will be controlled using the telop keyboard commands so in another terminal window, run; 

ros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key

Also for saving the data create a folder and locate to that using;

mkdir bag_files
cd bag_files

Since now th turtle bot simulation is running you can fin  dout which topics are published in the noe using the simple command; 

ros2 topic list

You will find a list of topics. During the previous lab session you learned that /turtle_teleop node publishes commands on the /turtle1/cmd_vel topic to make the turtle move in turtlesim. So let's dig into that using the command, 

ros2 topic echo /turtle1/cmd_vel

Now you will be able to see the data published on the node and lets capture these using, 
(ros2 bag record <topic>) 

ros2 bag record /turtle1/cmd_vel

Here this captures the data published on the topic cmd_vel. 

In the following command we will be capturing multiple topics. We also can provide a name for the bag file using -o <name>, and multiple topics need to captured and be listed with a space in between; 

ros2 bag record -o subset /turtle1/cmd_vel /turtle1/pose

Once recorded the bag file info can be obtained using “ ros2 bag info <name> “ and as for the example;

ros2 bag info subset

After retrieving the data it could be displayed using the command “ros2 bag play <name>” ;

ros2 bag play subset


Exercise :

Run the turtlebot with user input commands and record the data using the ros2 bag function.
Replay the movement of the turtlebot using the captured data.
Compare the visual appearance of the paths of the user input one and the replay of captured data.
